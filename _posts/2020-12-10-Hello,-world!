#Hello, world!

This is kind of boring stuff to write the first post in a feed. But I'll try.

The story has started when I entered the university and realized that I was too lazy to learn new things. After some months of these thought I understood that I have to get my own blog: to write down all my notes and share it with community.

Don't really think it will be helpful for somebody, but the try is a try.
