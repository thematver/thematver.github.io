title: Why should we fight with Big Tech today?

I am not Trump supporter, but I am right-winged. I am not racist, but I don't want "Black Lives Matter". I am not paranoic, but I do care for my data. Now I don't want to use Google, Microsoft and Facebook products anymore.

All the 2020 year we could see the new world government â€” The Big Tech. They solve what to censore, who to ban. They have lots of money and influnce, but they are just bussiness. Their fascist actions make me angry. I don't want any authoritarian regime to be here again. I want to be free. That's way today I'm replacing The Big Tech apps on my phone and computers with alternatives. For example, now I use DuckDuckGo or Yandex instead of Google, Telegram instead of WhatsApp. I replaced Word with LibreOffice. I also removed my Twitter accout. The next step (and the most serious for me) is to delete Instagram and Facebook. I also use Apple, but I find them some more honourful than companies above. 

Everyone should be free in saying whatever he wants. Even if it is a private company, imagine what you'll say if one day you won't see your favorite items in Google because they want to hide it. Or if you go to the private medicine center, and doctor will cut your an arm. 

So It's the best time for PiperNet. Richard Hendrics, the world is waiting for you.

I choose to be digitally free. And you?
