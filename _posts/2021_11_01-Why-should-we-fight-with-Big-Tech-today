title: Why should we fight with Big Tech today?
---

I am not Trump supporter, but I am right-winged.
I am not racist, but I don't want "Black Lives Matter".
I am not paranoic, but I do care for my data.

All the 2020 year we can see the new world government â€” The Big Tech. They solve what to censore, who to ban. They have lots of money and influnce, but they are just bussiness. Their fascist actions make me angry.
I don't want any authoritarian regime to be here again. I want to be free. That's way today I'm replacing The Big Tech apps on my phone and computers with alternatives. For example, now I use DuckDuckGo or Yandex instead of Google, Telegram instead of WhatsApp. I also removed my Twitter accout. The next step (and the most serious for me) is to delete Instagram and Facebook. I also use Apple, but I find them some more honourful than companies above. 

It's time for PiperNet.
Richard Hendrics, the world is waiting for you.

I choose to be digitally free. And you?
